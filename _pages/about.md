Hi, I’m Daniel Folino, a dual major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, graduating in May 2025. Growing up in Mexico and attending a German international school, I had a unique multicultural education that sparked my interest in both engineering and computing. I’m fluent in English, German, Spanish, and Dutch, and bring a global perspective to my work.

My journey includes a diverse range of experiences—from shadowing healthcare professionals at Hospital Angeles in Mexico to developing game projects and databases. I’ve also taken on process engineering challenges, like designing distillation columns and creating efficient plant simulations using tools like Aspen Hysys and Aspen Plus. Outside of academics, I represented Mexico as a national handball champion in 2015 and was part of the team that won the Central American Games with the U-17 squad.
