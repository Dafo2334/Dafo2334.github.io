<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Folino! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I'm a dual major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Chemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder, graduating in May 2025. Growing up in Mexico and attending a German international school gave me a unique multicultural foundation, sparking my passion for both engineering and computing. Fluent in English, German, Spanish, and Dutch, I bring a global perspective to every project I tackle.</p>

<p>My technical expertise spans process engineering, software development, and data science. Iâ€™ve tackled complex challenges like designing distillation columns and simulating plant processes using Aspen Hysys and Aspen Plus. In computing, Iâ€™ve delved into game development and database systems, with hands-on experience in RISC-V processor modeling and creating embedded systems. My minors in Math and Chemistry further enhance my analytical and problem-solving capabilities, complementing my engineering and computer science studies.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m particularly interested in networking and data science and have developed projects like a UDP client-server and explored data analysis in real-world applications. These experiences have strengthened my ability to solve complex problems through innovative, practical solutions.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I represented Mexico as a national handball champion in 2015 and was part of the U-17 team that won the Central American Games. Sports taught me the value of resilience, teamwork, and determinationâ€”qualities I bring to every endeavor, academic or professional.</p>

<p>Though Iâ€™m still building formal industry experience, Iâ€™ve been proactive in preparing for my career through leadership roles, hands-on projects, and academic challenges. With a multidisciplinary knowledge base, a global outlook, and a passion for problem-solving, Iâ€™m ready to tackle real-world challenges with enthusiasm and dedication.</p>
