<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Folino! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I'm a dual major in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Chemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder, graduating in May 2025. Growing up in Mexico and attending a German international school gave me a unique multicultural foundation, sparking my passion for both engineering and computing. Fluent in English, German, Spanish, and Dutch, I bring a global perspective to every project I tackle.</p>

<p>My technical interests lie in numerical computation, data science, machine learning, and AI. Iâ€™ve developed predictive models with high accuracy, implemented cross-validation and error reduction techniques, and built full-stack systems that integrate intelligent algorithms. Whether it's building a financial market predictor, training wildfire risk models, or simulating engineering systems in MATLAB and Aspen, I strive to solve complex problems with analytical precision and creative coding.</p>

<p>Beyond computation, Iâ€™ve tackled challenges in distillation design, reactor modeling, and process simulation, merging chemical engineering insight with software-driven automation. My R&D work ranges from robotics with TIAGo to optimizing process economics using tools like Aspen Plus and MATLAB. I enjoy bridging domains to deliver smart, scalable solutions.</p>

<p>Outside the lab and code editor, I was a national handball champion representing Mexico and won gold at the U-17 Central American Games. Sports shaped my sense of discipline and perseveranceâ€”traits that guide my work ethic and teamwork in every endeavor.</p>

<p>I'm always looking for meaningful challenges where I can apply and grow my multidisciplinary skill set. Letâ€™s build something great together!</p>
